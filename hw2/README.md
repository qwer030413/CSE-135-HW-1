2. Discussion of what third approach was for 3rd party: OnePageGA
For this, I explored many other options and read reddit and stack overflow posts for suggestions. I wanted a platform that alligns with privacy and also I only wanted lightweight reporting because I don't think I would look that into the analytics. 

* What I considered:  
I evaluated different types of services:
Privacy focused tools, Log based analytics, lightweight pages

At the end, I ended up picking this tool called OnePageGA  
I picked it because it was simple and was designed to be to have single purpose, hainv straight forward reportings and was really easy to use.  
it also had a really quick setup and it only took a few minutes to set everything up and get it going.  

The Evaluation:  
* Implementation: I just put my website and pasted the script in my website and the analytics started working instantly.
* The set up was quick as I mentioned above and was really easy to understand/straight forward  
* While the platform delivers the basic metrics well, It is not the best for deep behavioral analysis or detailed analysis like google analytics or etc  
* The tracking script was really light weight and did not affect my website at all.  

overall, OnePageGA provided a simple analytics option that delivered the core info I needed.
